This template deploys a DataStax Enterprise cluster to Azure running on Ubuntu virtual machines. The template also provisions a storage account, virtual network, availability sets, public IP addresses and network interfaces required by the installation.

The template expects the following parameters:

| Name   | Description |
|:--- |:---|
| region | Region where the Azure artifacts will be created |
| storageAccountPrefix  | Unique DNS name for the storage account where the virtual machine disks will be placed |
| dnsName | Domain name of the publicly accessible OpsCenter virtual machine.  This domain name will be appended to form the fully qualified name {domainName}.{region}.cloudapp.azure.com (e.g. mydomainname.westus.cloudapp.azure.com) | 
| virtualNetworkName | Name of the virtual network to be create and deployed to |
| adminUsername  | Admin user name for the virtual machines |
| adminPassword  | Admin password for the virtual machines |
| datastaxUsername | Your DataStax account username.  You can register at (datastax.com) |
| datastaxPassword | Your DataStax account password. |
| opsCenterAdminPassword | DataStax OpsCenter admin user password |
| clusterVmSize | The size of virtual machine to provision for each cluster node |
| clusterNodeCount | The number of virtual machines to provision for the cluster |
| clusterName | The name of the new cluster |

A configurable number of cluster nodes of a configurable size are created and prepared with prerequisites for OpsCenter. The cluster nodes IPs are statically assigned and only accessible on the internal virtual network.  After the cluster nodes are created, a single OpsCenter instance is provisioned.  It is responsible for provisioning and managing the cluster nodes.

Once the deployment is complete you can access the DataStax OpsCenter machine instance using the configured DNS address.  The OpsCenter instance has port 22 for SSH, port 8888 for HTTP and port 8443 for HTTPS enabled.  

The DNS address for OpsCenter will include the dnsName and region entered as parameters when creating a deployment based on this template in the format `{dnsName}.{region}.cloudapp.azure.com`. If you created a deployment with the dnsName parameter set to datastax in the West US region you could access the DataStax OpsCenter virtual machine for the deployment at `http://datastax.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:8443`.

NOTE: The certificate used in the deployment is a self signed certificate that will create a browser warning.  You can follow the process on the DataStax web site for replacing the certificate with your own SSL certificate.

##Known Issues and Limitations
- The template uses username/password for provisioning cluster nodes in the cluster. Ideally it would use an SSH key
- The template deploys Cassandra data nodes configured to use ephemeral storage and attaches a data disk that can be used for data backups in the event of a cluster failure resulting in the loss of the data on the ephemeral disks.  Ideally it would use premium storage and support a backup strategy.
